El Localizador was a project that I created in my senior year of high school. The goal was to create a program using Java and Java Swing that allowed the user to see all of the businesses within a radius they set, of a category that they select, and sort by either distance or rating. The rating was something that they would set themselves, it wasn't advanced enough to import Google reviews or Yelp or anything. They could rate it out of 5 stars and write a short description of their experience should they ever visit it again. It would also show them the location of the establishment, but wouldn't navigate or anything.
